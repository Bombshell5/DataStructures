# Stacks
## Introduction and explanation 
  We are going to be learning about stacks. Stacks are a really useful type of data structure since they offer order by implemeteting LIFO (Last-In-First-Out). As described the first item that goes in a stack is the one that will come out last.  
  The main operations of this data structure is ***push*** and ***pop***. Push(*data*) as it sounds will add *data* to the top of the stack. Pop() will remove the element from the top of the stack. For a better representation look at the image below.
