# Stacks
## Introduction and explanation 
  We are going to be learning about stacks. Stacks are a really useful type of data structure since they offer order by implemeteting LIFO (Last-In-First-Out). As described the first item that goes in a stack is the one that will come out last.  
  The main operations of this data structure is ***push*** and ***pop***. Push(*data*) as it sounds will add *data* to the top of the stack. Pop() will remove the element from the top of the stack. For a better representation look at the image below.

  ## Example Problem #1 
  ```python
  #There is a stack of pancakes each of different flavors
pancakes = ['strawberries', 'blueberries', 'raspberries', 'cranberries', 'chocolate', 'buttermilk', 'banana']
# Tommy favorite pancake flavors are chocolate, banana and blueberries, please create a stack of new pancakes for Tommy from the stack of pancakes given,
# you should use pop() and append() "push" to create the new stack of pancakes. 
tommyPancakes = [] 
#Your code goes here

print(tommyPancakes)  #[chocolate, banana, blueberries]

  ```
  ## Example Problem #2
